Description:

This is an HTML and CSS code that creates a form for Netflix sign-up page. The HTML code defines the structure of the page and the CSS code styles it.

The body tag defines the main content of the page, and it contains a div element with the class "container" that wraps the entire content of the page. The content of the page consists of a header with a logo and a description, and a section with a form for user input.

The header is defined by an header tag with the id "header" and contains two h1 and h3 tags with the ids "title" and "description", respectively. The "title" element has the word "NETFLIX" and a red span element inside it. The "description" element thanks the user for signing up and asks for more information about them.

The section with the form is defined by a section tag with the id "survey-form-container" and contains a form tag with an action attribute set to "result.html" and a method attribute set to "get". The form contains several input fields for the user to fill out, such as name, age, email, content type, movie type, gender, and feedback. The input fields are defined by input, select, and textarea tags.

The CSS code defines the styles for the page. It sets the margin, padding, and box-sizing properties of all elements to 0. It sets the background image and color of the body element, and the width, height, and background color of the container element. It also styles the title, description, input boxes, form, and submit button with various font, color, and positioning properties.
